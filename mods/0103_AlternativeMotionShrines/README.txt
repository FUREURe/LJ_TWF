***********************************
Alternative Motion Shrines by United Kings
***********************************
A mod that replaces the motion control puzzles of several shrines with new alternative challenges. That is, any of the "Apparatus" shrines which includes Katosa Aug, Myahm Agana, Ze Kasho, Joloo Nah, and Toto Sah shrines.
This mod aims to make these shrines completable without the headache of using the motion controls while maintaining some degree of challenge. I hope you enjoy.
